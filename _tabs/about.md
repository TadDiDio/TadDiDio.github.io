My name is Tad DiDio and I and a co-founder of Bucket of Fish Studios, an indie game dev company. I love writing softare that others can enjoy, whether thats the user or the other developers who have an easy time maintaining and adding to it. I put a lot of effort into learning and practicing writing maintainable systems that are testable, scalable, and flexible. I have professional software experience both from Bucket of Fish, and also from multiple internships at Northrop Grumman and I obtained a Master's degree from Virginia Tech in Computer Engineering. I enjoy going to the gym, making and playing games, playing pickleball, and cooking. Try checking out the Projects tab of my site to see some of the stuff I've made recently!
