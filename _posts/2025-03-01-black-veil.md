## About
Black Veil was a project that had been bouncing around in my mind for a while after a friend brought up the idea. I didn't have a lot of time, so I wasn't going to start developing it, but after making a small prototype of the core mechanic in a 48 hour game jam, I decided that it was well worth pursuing. This is a game in which players act as operatives of a top secret organization trying to contain paranormal threats. The main mechanic is that some of the paranormals are not visible to the human eye and must be seen using a camera. The game idea has changed and grown immensely since the rushed demo I made in 48 hours, but that demo served to highlight what was fun and what needed to change. Below is gameplay footage of result of the game jam.

## Technical
This project is utilizing all of the technical experience I have picked up from past projects, and it's a good thing too because writing excellent netcode is not easy. Having made mistakes and iterated and improved my skills through other projects has equipped me to allocate mental resources towards learning network programming while being able to confidently design scalable systems in other areas.
