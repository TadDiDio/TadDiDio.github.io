## About
Locomotive 115 is an action horror indie game about surviving a deadly train ride while managing resources. I worked as a lead software designer for Bucket of Fish on this project and we shipped it in Novemeber of 2024 after a 3 month development cycle. The game was intended as a preliminary test for our startup to see both how our skills meshed, and also reveal pitfalls in the entire software production/game design process. It became a massive success for us because not only did we acheive our goals of learning a lot, but we also sold nearly 1,500 copies to date! Below is the trailer for the game and also some gameplay footage!
